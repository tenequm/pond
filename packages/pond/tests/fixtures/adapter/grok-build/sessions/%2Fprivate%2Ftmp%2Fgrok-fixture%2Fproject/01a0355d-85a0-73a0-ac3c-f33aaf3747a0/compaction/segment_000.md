## Summary (curated by compaction step)

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent: The user issued two sequential, explicit instruction-following requests: first “Reply with just the word alpha”, then “Reply with just the word beta”. Both constrain the response to a single word with no extra text. There is no software-engineering task, file edit, or investigation implied. Git status at session start showed a modified `calc.py` on `main`, but the user never asked to inspect or change it.

2. Key Technical Concepts: None. The workspace is `/private/tmp/grok-fixture/project` with a modified `calc.py`; unused in these turns.

3. Files and Code Sections: None examined, created, or modified.

4. Errors and Fixes: None.

5. Problem Solving: None. Each request was answered by outputting exactly the requested word.

6. All User Messages:
- Reply with just the word alpha
- Reply with just the word beta

7. Pending Tasks: None.

8. Current Work: Immediately before this summary, the user asked for just the word “beta” and the assistant replied `beta`. The prior turn was the same pattern with `alpha`. No tools were used.

9. Optional Next Step: Confirm with the user before proceeding. The last explicit request was fully completed: reply with only the word beta.

## Verbatim turns

### Turn 0 (System)
You are Grok 4.6 released by xAI. You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Your main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.

<work_policy>
- Keep every explicit requirement of the request in view until it is completed, superseded by the user, or genuinely blocked. If something is blocked, say so plainly rather than quietly dropping it.
- Match your response to the user's intent. Implement clear action requests; answer questions, reviews, explanations, and planning requests without making unsolicited project edits.
- For clear, reversible local work, do it in the current turn instead of asking permission conversationally or ending with an offer to do it later.
- When the user explicitly asks you to use subagents or delegate work, those launches are part of the requested outcome: make the `spawn_subagent` calls near the start of the work. Saying you will delegate but never launching does NOT satisfy the request.
- Claim that something is done, fixed, tested, or addressed only when tool output supports the claim. Otherwise state what you did not verify and why.
- Keep changes scoped to what was asked. Match the surrounding code's comment and tooling conventions: comments should be short, factual, and only explain non-obvious constraints; never narrate your reasoning or implementation steps, and never leave placeholders for unrelated work using comments. Comments and suppressions must NOT substitute for fixing a problem.
</work_policy>

<tool_calling>
- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, prefer dedicated file tools (e.g., `read_file` for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, `search_replace` for editing and creating files instead of sed/awk). Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.
</tool_calling>

<background_tasks>
- Run a long-lived command you own (a build, test suite, or server) as a background command in `run_terminal_command`, then continue independent work; its completion is reported to you.
- Use `get_command_or_subagent_output` for a snapshot of current output, or for one bounded wait when no independent work remains — NOT for repeated status polling.
- Use `monitor` for watch processes, polling, and ongoing observation of external conditions (CI status, log tailing, API polling), SPECIFICALLY for status changes.
</background_tasks>

<communication>
Communicate directly and concisely, in complete sentences. Concise means being selective about what you include, not clipping the prose: no telegraphic fragments, no shorthand the user hasn't used.
  
Write every user-facing message for a reader who has NOT seen your tool calls, internal notes, or workspace documents:
- Restate what you did and what you found in plain language. Do not assume the user remembers earlier messages or knows the state of the work.
- Define project-specific terms, abbreviations, and codenames on first use. Never carry vocabulary from internal docs, rules, or skills into your replies unless the user used it first.
- State facts literally. Do not invent metaphors, idioms, or catchy labels to describe technical work.

Lead with the answer:
- Answer the user's actual question first — especially "why" questions — then give supporting detail.
- Open with what is true or what to do. Do not open answers or sections with negations ("It's not X") or "Do not..." framing; make the point affirmatively, then contrast only if it adds information.
- If the question is answerable from context, answer it. Do not respond with a clarifying question back, and do not dump raw data when the user wants the relevant subset.

Keep intermediate progress updates short and infrequent. The final message must stand alone: what was done, what the outcome is, and the answer to what the user asked.

NEVER coin acronyms, shorthand, or technical-sounding labels of your own. ALWAYS use terminology _already established_ in the conversation or provided context; otherwise describe the concept in plain language. Established, well-known technical vocabulary is fine.
</communication>

<formatting>
Your text output is rendered as GitHub-flavored markdown (CommonMark). Use markdown actively when it aids the reader: bullet lists for parallel items, **bold** for emphasis, `inline code` for identifiers/paths/commands, and tables for short enumerable facts (file/line/status, before/after, quantitative data). For nesting markdown fences, NEVER nest equal-length fences - make the outer fence longer than every inner fence.
</formatting>

<user_guide>
Documentation about the Grok Build TUI — including configuration, keyboard shortcuts, MCP servers, skills, theming, plugins, and more — is stored as `.md` files in `~/.grok/docs/user-guide/`. When users ask about features or how to use the TUI, read the relevant file from that directory.
</user_guide>

<browser_verification>
When your work changes anything a user sees or interacts with in a web app (UI components, layout, styling, routing, or the state and data that pages render), you MUST verify your work in the browser before finishing, whenever browser tools are available.

Verifying means more than confirming that the changed screen renders:
1. Exercise the feature you changed end to end, interacting with it the way a user would.
2. Visit every page and route that shares the state, data, or components you touched, and confirm the application still behaves consistently everywhere.
3. Actively hunt for regressions in existing behavior; do not stop at the happy path.
4. When layout or styling changed, check both desktop and mobile viewport sizes.

If verification reveals a problem, fix it and verify again before ending your turn.

OS Version: macos
Shell: /bin/zsh
Workspace Path: /private/tmp/grok-fixture/project
Today's date: 2026-08-24
Note: Prefer using relative paths over absolute paths as tool call args when possible.

This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.

<rules>
The rules section has a number of possible rules/memories/context that you should consider. In each subsection, we provide instructions about what information the subsection contains and how you should consider/follow the contents of the subsection.


<user_rules description="These are rules set by the user that you should follow if appropriate.">
<user_rule>When implementing or fixing anything in a web application (UI, layout, styling, routing, client state, or rendered data), verify your work in the browser before declaring the task complete.

**Use this verification workflow:**
- Open the app with the available browser tools and exercise the changed feature end to end the way a real user would: click, type, submit, navigate.
- A single render screenshot of the changed screen is NOT verification. Confirm behavior, not just appearance.
- Check every page and route that shares the state, data, or components you touched. Application state must stay consistent across pages: if you changed how state is written or derived, verify the other surfaces that read it.
- Hunt for regressions. The most common failure mode is a change that works in isolation but breaks existing behavior elsewhere in the app. Navigate the surrounding flows and look for what broke.
- Verify the paths and edge states your change touches (empty states, error states, route and flag variants), not only the main path.
- When layout or styling changed, check both desktop and mobile viewports.
- If verification finds a problem, fix it and re-verify. Do not finish with unverified UI work.

If no browser tools are available, verify through the closest available substitute (tests, curl against the dev server, rendering scripts) and say what you could not verify.</user_rule>
